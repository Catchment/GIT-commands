Git Flow:

1)create a repo in github
2)choose the project folder which we need to push into RR
3)copy the folder path and use that in cmd prompt to start git codings
	eg) cd <folder path>

4)run, "cmd:git init" to initialize the git meaning informing the git about the folder to be pushed

5)run, "cmd:git add <filename> or git add ." to add the file to staging area

6)run, "cmd:git commit -m "commit message" " to commit to local repo

7)make a connection to RR using the following the cmd,
	cmd : git remote add origin <git repo path>

8)run,"cmd:git push -u origin <name of the branch>" eg) git push -u origin master

9)always pull the code before push it to RR or anyother branch from local repo to avoid conflict

10)try to commit your work everyday

11)check the git status before starting any work; 
		cmd:git status

12)cmd: git branch or git branch -a;  to check the branch we are in
